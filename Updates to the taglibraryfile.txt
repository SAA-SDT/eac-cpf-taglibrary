Changes needed in the xml file to make the FO work

Every div that should occur in the table of contents need to have the attribute xml:id to work properly
The appendixes need to be numbered with the help of the attribute n
Examples using a different namespace like if the resourcerelation contains ead the elements need a prefix example to work with the FO. There are also the need of the schemaLocation attribute.
