Changes needed in the xml file to make the FO work

Every div that should occur in the table of contents need to have the attribute xml:id to work properly, the attribute is set with generate-id function
The appendixes need to be numbered with the help of the attribute n
Examples using a different namespace like if the resourcerelation contains ead the elements need a prefix example to work with the FO. There are also the need of the schemaLocation attribute. 
Using TEI as examples works sort of. Since the whole document is TEI the elements actually have a meaning. So to use TEI have text as namespace prefix and change the www name and remo -c to get it to work.

In publicationStmt it is valuable to have this <idno type="ISBN">123456789</idno> so it can be collected automatically
