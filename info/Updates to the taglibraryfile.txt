Changes needed in the xml file to make the FO work

Every div that should occur in the table of contents need to have the attribute xml:id to work properly, the attribute is set with generate-id function
The appendixes need to be numbered with the help of the attribute n
Examples using a different namespace like if the resourcerelation contains ead the elements need a prefix example to work with the FO. There are also the need of the schemaLocation attribute.

In publicationStmt it is valuable to have this <idno type="ISBN">123456789</idno> so it can be collected automatically
