               <eac-cpf:p>Cappellari was born at Belluno on 18 September 1765 to a noble family. At an
											early age he joined the order of the Camaldolese (part of the Benedictine monastic
											family) and entered the Monastery of San Michele di Murano, near Venice. As a Camaldolese
											monk, Cappellari rapidly gained distinction for his theological and linguistic skills.
											His first appearance before a wider public was in 1799, when he published against the
											Italian Jansenists a controversial work entitled <eac-cpf:span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">II Trionfo della Santa Sede</eac-cpf:span>, which besides
											passing through several editions in Italy, has been translated into several European
											languages. In 1800, he became a member of the Academy of the Catholic Religion, founded
											by Pope Pius VII (1800-1823), to which he contributed a number of memoirs on theological
											and philosophical questions, and in 1805 was made abbot of San Gregorio on the Caelian
											Hill.</eac-cpf:p>
