      <p xml:lang="en">A <gi>place</gi> element is a wrapper element used to encode an index term, using the
								child element <gi>placeEntry</gi>. Terms are used to identify the places or jurisdictions
								where the EAC-CPF entity was based, lived, or with which it had some other significant
								connection. The <gi>placeRole</gi> element is available to specify the nature of the
								connection of the place with the entity being described, and its use is strongly
								recommended. Terms in <gi>placeEntry</gi> and <gi>placeRole</gi> may be drawn from
								controlled vocabularies or may be natural language terms. These controlled vocabularies can
								be identified with the <att>vocabularySource</att> attribute. Associated date or date range
									(<gi>date</gi>, <gi>dateRange</gi> or <gi>dateSet</gi>) information may be included
								to further constrain the term's meaning. A <gi>descriptiveNote</gi> may be included if a
								fuller textual explanation is needed. An <gi>address</gi> element is also available for
								specifying a postal or other address. A <gi>descriptiveNote</gi> element may be included
								for more detailed specifications or explanation of the relation between the values.</p>
      <p xml:lang="en">A single <gi>place</gi> element may be encoded directly within <gi>description</gi>.
								Alternatively, multiple <gi>place</gi> elements may be grouped within a <gi>places</gi>
								wrapper that facilitates manipulating them as a group.</p>
      <p xml:lang="en">Places may alternatively be described in discursive form in <gi>biogHist</gi> (ISAAR
								(CPF) History 5.2.2). The <gi>place</gi> element should be used whenever separate semantic
								processing of information about places is required.</p>
