      <p xml:lang="en">A <gi>function</gi> element is a wrapper element used to encode an index term, using the
								child element <gi>term</gi>. Terms are used to identify the functions, processes,
								activities, tasks, or transactions performed by the EAC-CPF entity. They may be drawn from
								controlled vocabularies or may be natural language terms. Associated date or date range
									(<gi>date</gi>, <gi>dateRange</gi> or <gi>dateSet</gi>) and place(s)
									(<gi>placeEntry</gi>) may be included to further constrain the term’s meaning. A
									<gi>descriptiveNote</gi> may be included if a fuller textual explanation is needed.</p>
      <p xml:lang="en">A single <gi>function</gi> element may be encoded directly within
								<gi>description</gi>. Alternatively, multiple <gi>function</gi> elements may be grouped
								within a <gi>functions</gi> wrapper that facilitates manipulating them as a group.</p>
      <p xml:lang="en">Functions may alternatively be described in discursive form in <gi>biogHist</gi> (ISAAR
								(CPF) History 5.2.2). The <gi>function</gi> element should be used whenever separate
								semantic processing of information about functions is required.</p>
      <p xml:lang="en">As a further alternative, descriptions of functions may form discrete components in an
								archival descriptive system. Such descriptions should be compiled in accordance with the
								International Standard for Describing Functions (ISDF) and will typically be described in
								another encoding language. In such a system, use <gi>functionRelation</gi> to point from
								the EAC-CPF entity to the related function description. In these systems, the
									<gi>function</gi> element will probably become redundant.</p>
