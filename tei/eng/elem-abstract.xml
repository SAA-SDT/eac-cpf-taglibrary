               <eac-cpf:p>Hubert H. Humphrey was born in Wallace, South Dakota, on May 27,
                  1911. He left South Dakota to attend the University of Minnesota but
                  returned to South Dakota to help manage his fathers drug store early
                  in the depression. He attended the Capitol College of Pharmacy in
                  Denver, Colorado, and became a register pharmacist in 1933. On
                  September 3, 1936, Humphrey married Muriel Fay Buck. He returned
                  to the University of Minnesota and earned a B.A. degree in 1939. In
                  1940 he earned an M.A. in political science from Louisiana State
                  University and returned to Minneapolis to teach and pursue further
                  graduate study, he began working for the W.P.A. (Works Progress
                  Administration). He moved on from there to a series of positions with
                  wartime agencies. In 1943, he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of
                  Minneapolis and returned to teaching as a visiting professor at
                  Macalester College in St. Paul. Between 1943 and 1945 Humphrey
                  worked at a variety of jobs. In 1945, he was elected Mayor of
                  Minneapolis and served until 1948. In 1948, at the Democratic
                  National Convention, he gained national attention when he delivered a
                  stirring speech in favor of a strong civil rights plank in the partys
                  platform. In November of 1948, Humphrey was elected to the United
                  States Senate. He served as the Senate Democratic Whip from 1961 to
                  1964.</eac-cpf:p>
               <eac-cpf:p>In 1964, at the Democratic National Convention, President Lyndon B.
                  Johnson asked the convention to select Humphrey as the Vice
                  Presidential nominee. The ticket was elected in November in a
                  Democratic landslide. In 1968, Humphrey was the Democratic
                  Partys candidate for President, but he was defeated narrowly by
                  Richard M. Nixon. After the defeat, Humphrey returned to Minnesota
                  to teach at the University of Minnesota and Macalester College. He
                  returned to the U.S. Senate in 1971, and he won re-election in 1976.
                  He died January 13, 1978 of cancer.</eac-cpf:p>
