				<head>Dedication</head>
				<p>The Encoded Archival Context Working dedicates the 2010 EAC-CPF Schema and Tag Library to the
					memory of Per-Gunnar Ottosson. P-G, as he was known to his many friends around the world,
					played a key role in the development of many international archival standards. He played a
					critical role in the early development of EAC, but illness and his death in 2008 prevented him
					from seeing the EAC-CPF work completed. He will be remembered for his keen intelligence,
					collaborative skills, and wonderful wit. Above all, he will be fondly remembered as a friend.

				<head>Release and Revision Notes</head>
				<p>The EAC-CPF Tag Library should be considered a living document. As such, it will continue to
					to be developed as users suggest areas in need of clarification or expansion. The EAC Working
					Group encourages implementers to provide any queries, comments, and suggestions regarding the
					tag library and its content. In addition, the contribution of examples is highly encouraged.
					Questions, comments or examples may be directed to the Chair of the EAC Working Group,
					Katherine M. Wisser (<ref target="mailto:wisser@simmons.edu">wisser [at]
					simmons.edu</ref>).</p>
				<p>The underlying encoding of the Tag Library is based on TEI P5 and is designed to facilitate
					incorporating documentation into the schema to provide guidance in XML editors. While the
					initial release of the Tag Library is in English, the underlying encoding is designed to
					facilitate providing the Tag Library in additional languages at later dates.</p>
				<p>A PDF version of the Tag Library will also be released at a later date.</p>

				<head>Background</head>
				<p>EAC began with a 1998 effort by Richard Szary, Wendy Duff, and Daniel Pitti to envision a
					standard for encoding and exchanging authoritative information about the context of archival
					materials. This standard would provide a communication standard for the exchange of authority
					records based on International Standard for Archival Authority Records&#x2014;Corporate Bodies,
					Persons, Families (ISAAR(CPF)) and would parallel the standard for encoding archival record
					finding aids that was found in Encoded Archival Description (EAD). As EAD enabled the practical
					expression of General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G)), the new standard
					would enable the expression of ISAAR(CPF). A parallel standard would preserve and strengthen
					the essential duality that characterizes archival description when it is presented in archival
					finding aids.</p>
				<p>A separate standard would pave the way to eliminating some practical problems found in the
					use of EAD, which had been developed as a comprehensive solution for encoding standalone
					finding aids—the dominant presentation model—which held all forms of descriptive data about
					archival records. Since materials by or about a single entity might be found in many fonds or
					many repositories, there is much redundant effort in recording information about the same
					entity. In addition, these duplicative efforts can result in great inconsistency, which
					bedevils both users, in finding and interpreting materials, and archivists, in creating
					accurate and complete references to such entities.</p>
				<p>Yale University hosted an international meeting in 1998. The meeting was organized by Richard
					Szary and funded by the Digital Library Federation. The goals of the meeting were to plan the
					funding and development of an encoding standard based on ISAAR(CPF).</p>
				<p>In 2001, with financial assistance from the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, a second
					international working group met in Toronto. This meeting produced the Toronto Tenets, the
					principles that gave shape to the proposed standard. The group also established goals for the
					standard, mapped out the broader parameters of the Document Type Definition (DTD), and
					established a working group to create a fully formed syntax. The DTD achieved its Beta
					distribution in 2004, beginning a long testing phase as it was applied in several European and
					U.S. projects. Informed by the results that emerged from this testbed, the Society of American
					Archivists' Encoded Archival Context Working Group was formed in 2007 to carry this work
					forward to the creation of a standard version, and expression in a schema and Tag Library. With
					the support of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, the IBC (Instituto per I beni artistici
					culturali e naturali) of the Regione Emilia-Romagna, the Archivio di Stato di Bologna, OCLC
					Research, and the National Library of Australia, the EAC Working Group met for three days in
					Bologna, Italy in May 2008 to lay the foundation of the existing EAC-CPF standard. On-going
					work via electronic mail and conference calls continued the work started in Bologna. A review
					period of the final draft was offered in August to November 2009, and completed schema was
					released in February 2010. The Working Group is indebted to archivists throughout the
					international community for their input, review, and testing of the schema during its
					development phase.</p>
				<p>Archival description includes information about the content, intellectual and physical
					attributes of the material, as well as information about the context of their creation and use.
					The context of the creation and use of material is complex and multi-layered and may involve
					individuals, families, organizations, societies, functions, activities, business processes,
					geographic places, events, and other entities. Primary among these entities are the agents
					responsible for the creation or use of material, usually organizations or persons. With
					information about these agents, users can understand and interpret the records more fully since
					they will know the context within which the agents operated and created and/or used the
					material. Contextual information about these agents can be used either as a component within
					descriptive approaches that fully integrate contextual information into descriptive products,
					as archives have traditionally done, or as an independent system that is linked to other
					descriptive systems and products that focus on content.</p>
				<p>Encoded Archival Context – Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF) primarily
					addresses the description of individuals, families and corporate bodies that create, preserve,
					use and are responsible for and/or associated with records in a variety of ways. Over time,
					other types of contextual entities may evolve under the larger EAC umbrella, but currently its
					primary purpose is to standardize the encoding of descriptions about agents to enable the
					sharing, discovery and display of this information in an electronic environment. It supports
					the linking of information about one agent to other agents to show/discover the relationships
					amongst record-creating entities, and the linking to descriptions of records and other
					contextual entities.</p>
				<p>EAC-CPF is a communication structure for archival contextual information for individuals,
					corporate bodies and families. It supports the exchange of ISAAR (CPF) compliant authority
					records. ISAAR (CPF) "determines the types of information that could be included in an archival
					authority record and provides guidance on how such records may be deployed in an archival
					descriptive system." ISAAR (CPF) also notes that "[s]uccessful automated exchange of archival
					authority information over computer networks is dependent upon the adoption of a suitable
					communication format by the repositories involved in the exchange. Encoded Archival Context
					(EAC) is one such communication format which supports the exchange of ISAAR(CPF) compliant
					archival authority data over the World Wide Web" (ISAAR (CPF), 2003, 15). EAC-CPF provides a
					mechanism for enabling the full expression of ISAAR (CPF), however it may also contain some
					additional elements or technical content not contained within ISAAR (CPF).</p>
				<p>Based upon the Toronto Tenets, established in 2001, the following have informed the
					development of the schema: <list type="ordered">
						<head>Definitions and Uses</head>
						<item n="1">Archival context information consists of information describing the circumstances
							under which archival materials have been created, maintained and used. This context includes,
							but is not limited to, the identification and characteristics of the persons, organizations,
							and families (agents) who have been the creators, users, or subjects of records, as well as
							the relationships amongst them.</item>
						<item n="2">Context information about agents is not data that describes other information
							resources, but rather data that describes entities that are part of the environment in which
							those information resources (e.g., records) have existed.</item>
						<item n="3">The recording of context information about agents in archival information systems
							directly supports a more complete description and understanding of records, as well as the
							provenance approach to retrieval of these records across time and domains.</item>
						<item n="4">Context information about agents can also have value as an independent information
							resource, separate from its use in supporting the description, retrieval, and interpretation
							of records.</item>
						<item n="5">This model is also intended to support the exchange and sharing of context
							information about agents, especially in those instances where repositories have holdings or
							interests that have context information in common.</item>
					</list>
					<list type="ordered">
						<head>Structure and Content</head>
						<item n="6">Each instance of context information about agents describes a single
							entity.</item>
						<item n="7">The model provides a framework within which the full range and depth of context
							information about agents can be recorded and suggests a minimum set of elements for
							describing an entity, but defers recommendations for the appropriate use of other elements to
							application guidelines developed for specific implementations.</item>
						<item n="8">The model defines a universe of elements used to describe agents and the structure
							of interrelationships amongst those elements. These elements and structure support the
							discovery, navigation and presentation of context information about agents and the linking of
							that information to descriptions of archival material or to other contextual entities,
							especially those encoded according to EAD, MARC, and similar standards.</item>
						<item n="9">The model supports the linking of descriptions of contextual entities to digital
							or other surrogate representations of those entities.</item>
					</list>
					<list type="ordered">
						<head>Technical Issues</head>
						<item n="10">The model is expressed as an XML language to encourage platform independence and
							portability of information. The model may also be implemented using other approaches.</item>

				<head>EAC-CPF Concepts</head>
				<p>Agents are complex. For example, one agent can consist of multiple identities, or a single
					identity can be associated with several different agents. This fact necessitates the structure
					of this standard to account for the various ways in which agents can be expressed. In order to
					accommodate the variety of agents, several concepts are defined:</p>
				<list type="simple">
					<item>SINGLE IDENTITY: one person (or corporate body or family) with a single identity
						represented in one EAC-CPF instance. (Most common)</item>
					<item>MULTIPLE IDENTITY-MANY IN ONE: two or more identities (including official identities)
						with each represented by distinct descriptions within one EAC-CPF instance. Can be
						programmatically converted into Multiple Identity-One in Many. (Less common though not
						rare).</item>
					<item>MULTIPLE IDENTITY-ONE IN MANY: two or more identities (including official identities)
						each represented in two or more interrelated EAC-CPF instances. Can be programmatically
						converted into Multiple Identity-Many in One. (Less common though not rare).</item>
					<item>ALTERNATIVE SET: derived EAC-CPF instance that is based on and incorporates two or more
						alternative EAC-CPF instances for the same entity. To be used by a consortia or a utility
						providing union access to authority records maintained in two or more systems by two or more
						agencies. Alternative EAC-CPF instances may be in different languages or in the same
						language.</item>
					<item>COLLABORATIVE IDENTITY: a single identity shared by two or more persons (e.g. a shared
						pseudonym used in creation of a collaborative work). Use Multiple Identity-One in Many.
						(Rare).</item>
				</list>
				<p>EAC-CPF has been created to accommodate this variety of identities, and includes a number of
					ways to express complexities based on individual repository or aggregator preferences. These
					options reflect a design principle that underscores increased opportunity for repositories or
					aggregators to customize the standard for specific needs while at the same time ensuring future
					aggregation. These flexibilities also reflect an acknowledgement that some fundamental
					philosophical differences with regard to the description of identity exist in the international
					community. EAC-CPF maintains a neutral stance on those philosophical differences, and instead
					has accommodated the various options without precluding aggregation in the future.</p>
				<p>For purposes of this tag library, agents refer to repositories or services creating or
					maintaining EAC-CPF records, while entities refer to those for which the records are about.</p>

				<head>Overview of EAC-CPF Structure and Semantics</head>
				<div>
					<head>Introduction</head>
					<p>Each EAC-CPF document contains two mandatory elements, the <tag>control</tag> element and
						either the element <tag>cpfDescription</tag> or <tag>multipleIdentities</tag>. The
							<tag>control</tag> element contains data used in the control of the entity description, and
						to provide context for that description. <tag>cpfDescription</tag> contains information on the
						name structures, descriptive elements, and relationships. <tag>multipleIdentities</tag> is
						used when there is more than one <tag>cpfDescription</tag>. These two wrapper elements contain
						specific elements to support the functional intentions of the parent or containing
						element.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>
						<tag>control</tag>
					</head>
					<p>The <tag>control</tag> element contains the following subelements:</p>
					<list type="simple">
						<item>
							<tag>recordId</tag> - EAC-CPF identifier. Contains one or more unique identifiers for the
							EAC-CPF instance. Required.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>maintenanceAgency</tag> - Maintenance agency. Name and coded information about the
							institution or service responsible for the creation, maintenance, and/or dissemination of the
							EAC-CPF instance. Required.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>maintenanceStatus</tag> - Maintenance status. Contains the current drafting status of
							the EAC-CPF instance. Values include: new, revised, deleted, cancelled, deletedSplit, or
							deletedReplaced. Required.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>maintenanceHistory</tag> - Maintenance History. Contains information about the date,
							type and events within the life cycle of an EAC-CPF instance. Contains one or more
								<tag>maintenanceEvent</tag> elements that document creating, importing, updating, and
							deletion of the description. Each maintenance event contains an agent, the type of agent
							(human or machine), the type of event, a description of the event, and the date of the event.
							Required.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>publicationStatus</tag> - Publication Status. Contains information about the editorial
							status of the EAC-CPF instance. Optional. </item>
						<item>
							<tag>languageDeclaration</tag> - Language declaration. Contains coded and natural language
							information about the language of the EAC-CPF instance. Required.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>sources</tag> - Sources. Contains information about the sources consulted in creating
							the description of the entity or entities in the EAC-CPF instance. Contains one or more
								<tag>source</tag> element. Required.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>conventionDeclaration</tag> - Convention declaration. Contains information on the rules
							used to construct the EAC-CPF instance, in particular the names formed in <tag>identity</tag>
							and the controlled vocabularies and thesauri used in the EAC-CPF instance. Optional.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>otherRecordId</tag> - Other Record Identifier. An element that allows the recording of
							additional identifiers that may be associated with the EAC-CPF instance. Optional.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>localControl</tag> - Local Control. An element in which to record any control entries
							necessary due to local practice that are not represented by the other elements in
								<tag>control</tag>. Optional.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>localTypeDeclaration</tag> - Local Type Declaration. An element used to declare local
							conventions used in the <att>localType</att> attribute. </item>
					</list>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>
						<tag>cpfDescription</tag>
					</head>
					<p>The <tag>cpfDescription</tag>-Corporate body, person or family description, comprises the
						description of the entity. Similar to the <tag>control</tag> element,
							<tag>cpfDescription</tag> has several complex subelements used to describe different features
						of the entity:</p>
					<list type="simple">
						<item>
							<tag>identity</tag> - Identity. Complex structure containing the name or names used by the
							entity over the course of the entity’s existence. Contains a repeatable <tag>nameEntry</tag>
							element for different names, and a repeatable <tag>nameEntryParallel</tag> element for more
							than one <tag>nameEntry</tag> expressed in different languages. Required.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>description</tag> - Description. Contains formal description elements parallel to those
							in ISAAR (CPF) for the description of the entity. An additional <tag>localDescription</tag>
							allows for local implementation of additional descriptive information not included in the
							other <tag>description</tag> elements. Optional.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>relations</tag> - Relations. Contains one or more references to or descriptions of
							related corporate bodies, persons or families <tag>cpfRelation</tag>, functions
								<tag>functionRelation</tag>, or resources <tag>resourceRelation</tag>. Optional.</item>
						<item><tag>alternativeSet</tag> - Alternative set. Contains two or more authority records for
							the same entity derived from two or more authority systems, expressed within a single EAC-CPF
							instance. The <tag>alternativeSet</tag> consists of two or more <tag>setComponent</tag>
							elements for the authority records.</item>
					</list>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>
						<tag>identity</tag>
					</head>
					<p>The most complex element in the EAC-CPF schema is the <tag>identity</tag> element. In
						addition to needing to accommodate one or more names used for or by the entity,
							<tag>identity</tag> must accommodate two or more parallel names in different languages or
						scripts. In countries where there is more than one official language, such as Canada, names of
						corporate bodies have more than one language. The <tag>identity</tag> contains a required
							<tag>entityType</tag> and one or more <tag>nameEntry</tag> and/or
							<tag>nameEntryParallel</tag> elements. It also includes an optional <tag>entityId</tag> and
							<tag>descriptiveNote</tag>. The <tag>nameEntry</tag> element is constructed of one or more
							<tag>part</tag> elements and contains the attributes <att>scriptCode</att>,
							<att>xml:lang</att>, <att>transliteration</att>, and <att>localType</att> to provide
						precision about the language and script of the names if desired. It includes an optional
							<tag>useDates</tag> element to identify dates of use of a name. <tag>nameEntryParallel</tag>,
						which is intended for use when the same name is expressed in different languages, contains one
						or more <tag>nameEntry</tag> elements and an optional <tag>useDates</tag> element. For
						example, within the context of the Archive of Ontario, parallel French and English headings
						can be designated by placing the repository code of the Archive in two parallel
							<tag>nameEntry</tag> elements, with the two different headings being distinguished by the
						values in the <att>xml:lang</att>.</p>
					<p>Within <tag>identity</tag>, names represented through <tag>nameEntry</tag> or
							<tag>nameEntryParallel</tag> may be selected as authorized or variant names. The
							<tag>authorizedForm</tag> and <tag>alternativeForm</tag> elements are available within
							<tag>nameEntry</tag> and <tag>nameEntryParallel</tag> elements to identify the status of the
						name according to a particular set of rules. The content of the element is the identification
						of those rules. Additionally, within <tag>nameEntryParallel</tag>, a single
							<tag>nameEntry</tag> may be preferred over others. A <tag>preferredForm</tag> element is
						available in that instance to identify the preferred form of the name according to a
						particular set of rules. The content of the element identifies those rules.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>
						<tag>description</tag>
					</head>
					<p>The <tag>description</tag> accommodates a variety of both controlled and prose descriptions
						of entities. The contained elements closely reflect the descriptive categories outlined in
						ISAAR (CPF). Descriptive elements generally have a singular and plural form, the latter being
						used for those cases of multiple instances of a descriptive category or less formal prose
						description. For example, <tag>function</tag> would be used for a single function term,
							<tag>functions</tag> will bundle more than one function descriptor or alternatively, it will
						allow a discursive description. Most elements within <tag>description</tag> include an
						optional <tag>descriptiveNote</tag> element to provide explanatory text. Elements for
						description include:</p>
					<list type="simple">
						<item>
							<tag>existDates</tag> &#x2014; dates of existence of the entity being described. Can include
							actual or approximate dates, using either <tag>date</tag>, <tag>dateRange</tag>, or
								<tag>dateSet</tag>.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>place</tag> &#x2014; includes relevant location information, optionally paired with
							related date information. Includes elements <tag>placeEntry</tag> and <tag>placeRole</tag>
							and the range of possibilities with date information: <tag>date</tag>, <tag>dateRange</tag>,
								<tag>dateSet</tag>.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>localDescription</tag> &#x2014; An element intended to extend the descriptive categories
							available in a local system. Includes a <tag>term</tag> element and the range of
							possibilities with date information: <tag>date</tag>, <tag>dateRange</tag>,
								<tag>dateSet</tag>.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>legalStatus</tag> &#x2014; Includes the legal status of a corporate body, typically
							defined by authorities and granted by either a government or an authorized agency. Includes a
								<tag>term</tag> element and the range of possibilities with date information:
								<tag>date</tag>, <tag>dateRange</tag>, <tag>dateSet</tag>.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>function</tag> &#x2014; Includes relevant functions, processes, activities, tasks, or
							transactions performed by the entity being described. Includes a <tag>term</tag> element and
							the range of possibilities with date information: <tag>date</tag>, <tag>dateRange</tag>,
								<tag>dateSet</tag>.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>occupation</tag> &#x2014; Includes relevant occupations held by the entity being
							described. Includes a <tag>term</tag> element and the range of possibilities with date
							information: <tag>date</tag>, <tag>dateRange</tag>, <tag>dateSet</tag>.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>mandate</tag> &#x2014; Includes relevant mandates for corporate bodies being described.
							Includes a <tag>term</tag> element and the range of possibilities with date information:
								<tag>date</tag>, <tag>dateRange</tag>, <tag>dateSet</tag>.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>structureOrGenealogy</tag> &#x2014; Includes information about the structure of a
							corporate body or the genealogy of a person or family. Includes elements <tag>outline</tag>,
								<tag>list</tag>, and <tag>p</tag> to assist in structuring the text.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>generalContext</tag> &#x2014; Includes information about the general social and cultural
							context of the entity being described. Includes a <tag>term</tag> element and the range of
							possibilities with date information: <tag>date</tag>, <tag>dateRange</tag>,
								<tag>dateSet</tag>.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>biogHist</tag> &#x2014; Includes discursive text providing biographical and/or
							historical information about the entity being described. Includes an <tag>abstract</tag>
							element for a brief synopsis of the full content; a <tag>chronList</tag> element allows for
							structured date, event and optional place information. Includes <tag>list</tag>,
								<tag>outline</tag>, <tag>p</tag> elements to assist in structuring the text.</item>
					</list>
					<p> All elements in <tag>description</tag> provide a <att>localType</att> attribute to provide
						semantic specificity to the term being used. With the exception of <tag>existDates</tag>,
							<tag>structureOrGenealogy</tag>, <tag>generalContext</tag>, and <tag>biogHist</tag>, plural
						form wrapper elements are available to bundle multiple occurrences of these elements. These
						wrapper elements also include elements <tag>citation</tag>, <tag>list</tag>,
							<tag>outline</tag>, and <tag>p</tag> to accommodate greater complexity in representing the
						description being created.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>
						<tag>relations</tag>
					</head>
					<p>As a component of archival description, entity description must be brought into relation
						with the other descriptive components. Entity descriptions must be dynamically related to the
						record descriptions for which they provide context, and the functions and activities in which
						the entities engage and that the records document. With the exception of unique relations, it
						is the nature of relations that they take place among entities and not within them. Entities
						are related to other entities, to activities and functions, and to records. Similarly,
						activities and functions are related to other functions and activities, to creators, and to
						records; and records are related to other records, to entities, and to functions and
						activities. Each entity, record, or function/activity description can thus function as a node
						in a set of relations.</p>
					<p>Because relations occur between the descriptive nodes, they are most efficiently created and
						maintained outside of each node. A person, for example, can be related to one or more persons,
						organizations or families; to one or more archival records, books, journals, and museum
						objects; and to various occupations and activities. Each of the related entities can be
						related to one or more other entities. To record all of these relations in the description of
						each node is inefficient, as correction of an error would require updating two or more
						descriptions.</p>
					<p>While maintaining relations independent of descriptions is efficient, when communicating
						descriptions between systems or to users it will be necessary to assemble or gather and
						represent the related descriptions using descriptive surrogates. Each surrogate for a related
						description will optimally include both human- and machine-readable information. The
						human-readable information provides succinct descriptions of the related entity, entity
						records, or function/activity sufficient to enable identification and a relevancy judgment.
						The machine-readable information supports a traversable link to the related description.</p>
					<p>There are three elements for describing relations with other descriptive entities that are
						included in the <tag>relations</tag> element: <tag>cpfRelation</tag>,
							<tag>functionRelation</tag>, <tag>resourceRelation</tag>. Within each of these relations
						elements, there are: <tag>relationEntry</tag>, <tag>objectXMLWrap</tag>,
							<tag>objectBinWrap</tag>, <tag>date</tag>, <tag>dateRange</tag>, <tag>dateSet</tag>,
							<tag>placeEntry</tag> and <tag>descriptiveNote</tag> elements. Individual relations include
						optional attributes related to the type of relation that is being described. These
						include:</p>
					<list type="simple">
						<item>
							<tag>cpfRelation</tag> &#x2014; includes an attribute <att>cpfRelationType</att>; values are
							identity, hierarchical, hierarchical-parent, hierarchical-child, temporal, temporal-earlier,
							temporal-later, family, associative.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>functionRelation</tag> &#x2014; includes an attribute <att>functionRelationType</att>;
							values include controls, owns, performs.</item>
						<item>
							<tag>resourceRelation</tag> &#x2014; includes an attribute <att>resourceRelationType</att>;
							values include creatorOf, subjectOf, other.</item>
					</list>
					<p>Other attributes available for the relation elements include
						<att>lastDateTimeVerified</att>, and the suite of simple Xlink attributes.</p>
					<p>There are two principal rationales behind the primitive or basic typing of relations. First,
						there is general interest in enabling coherent expression and navigation of relations as well
						as creation of graphic displays of organizational charts, family trees, and time lines. The
						primitives are an experimental attempt to provide the data necessary to construct such
						displays. At this point, there has been no attempt to test the utility of the structures with
						graphic displays. Second, basic information about the nature of relations is necessary in
						order to make the relationship intelligible to users. Given cultural and institutional
						differences, the number of possible relation types is, in principle, unlimited. EAC-CPF
						designers decided, though, that to achieve a minimum level of functionality there needed to be
						consensus on a set of basic or primitive relation types.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>xlink</head>
					<p>The EAC-CPF schema includes support for linking to external resources using a limited subset
						of the xlink standard, which is defined at <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/"
							>http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/</ref>. The xlink attributes can be used to create and describe
						links between resources. In particular they can be used to reference a richer set of
						relationships than those which are supported by @cpfRelationType, @functionRelationType, and
						@resourceRelationtype. The xlink attributes are available on the following elements:
							<tag>citation</tag>, <tag>cpfRelation</tag>, <tag>functionRelation</tag>,
							<tag>resourceRelation</tag>, <tag>setComponent</tag>, and <tag>source</tag>.</p>
					<p>A more complete description of each these attributes is provided in the attributes section
						of the tag library, but the following information is intended to summarize how they might be
						used in conjunction with each other.</p>
					<list type="simple">
						<head>Xlink Type Attribute</head>
						<item><att>xlink:type</att> &#x2014; This attribute is required if any of the other xlink
							attributes are used on the parent element. It takes the fixed value of 'simple' since
							EAC-CPF's implementation of xlink only supports outbound links to one resource. If multiple
							outbound links are required, each link should be represented in a new parent element.</item>
					</list>
					<list type="simple">
						<head>Locator Attribute</head>
						<item><att>xlink:href</att> &#x2014; This optional element may be used to provide the location
							of the resource that is being linked to. The link must be a valid URI.</item>
					</list>
					<list type="simple">
						<head>Semantic Attributes</head>
						<item><att>xlink:arcrole</att> &#x2014; This optional element may be used on
								<tag>cpfRelation</tag>, <tag>functionRelation</tag>, and <tag>resourceRelation</tag> to
							provide a precise description of the relationship between the entity described in the EAC-CPF
							resource and the resource to which it is linked. When used on <tag>citation</tag>,
								<tag>setComponent</tag>, and<tag>source</tag>, it provides an explicit and perhaps more
							precise description of the relationship that is implied by the context of use. The value must
							be a valid URI.</item>
						<item><att>xlink:role</att> &#x2014; This optional element is used to provide a reference to
							the nature of the linked remote resource. It specifically provides a means to specify the
							nature of a linked resource in <tag>resourceRelation</tag>, as described in ISAAR (CPF) 6.2.
							The value provided must be a valid URI.</item>
					</list>
					<list type="simple">
						<head>Link Behavior Attributes </head>
						<item><att>xlink:actuate</att> &#x2014; This optional attributed may be used in conjunction
							with xlink: show to instruct an external application as to the circumstances under which the
							linked resource should be resolved. For example, an application can be instructed to load the
							resource when the parent xml document is loaded or only when the page is requested by a user
							or application.</item>
						<item><att>xlink:show</att> &#x2014; This optional attribute may be used in conjunction with
							xlink:actuate to instruct an external application as to the manner in which the linked
							resource should be shown to the user when it is resolved. For example, the application can be
							instructed to replace the current xml document when loading the resource or to load it in a
							new window or tab.</item>
						<item><att>xlink:title</att> &#x2014; This optional element may be used to provide a caption
							or title that an external system or application may use when presenting a link to the
							user.</item>
					</list>
					<p>Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox are the only common client application which include
						native support for a limited range of xlink attributes. As a result, implementers of EAC-CPF
						will need to provide for the full implementation of the xlink attributes using server-side
						instructions. One implementation example, demonstrating the intended effects of xlink usage,
						is provided at <ref target="http://www.snee.com/xml/xlink/sxlinkdemo.xml"
							>http://www.snee.com/xml/xlink/sxlinkdemo.xml</ref>.</p>
					<p>The following excerpt provides one example of how xlink might be implemented in reference to
						an external vocabulary, to indicate that the information at the related URL describes the
						spouse of the person described in the EAC-CPF record:</p>

							<tag>cpfRelation</tag>, <tag>resourceRelation</tag>, and <tag>functionRelation</tag>

					<p>As an international effort, the designers of EAC-CPF are attempting to agree on as much as

					<p>In addition to the element <tag>localDescription</tag>, described above, many elements may
						also be qualified with <att>localType</att>. This attribute is intended to enable EAC-CPF to
						be adapted for use in national, regional, and local environments where semantics more specific

										<eac-cpf:p>Cappellari was born at Belluno on 18 September 1765 to a noble family. At an
											early age he joined the order of the Camaldolese (part of the Benedictine monastic
											family) and entered the Monastery of San Michele di Murano, near Venice. As a Camaldolese
											monk, Cappellari rapidly gained distinction for his theological and linguistic skills.
											His first appearance before a wider public was in 1799, when he published against the
											Italian Jansenists a controversial work entitled <eac-cpf:span localType="title"
												style="font-style:italic">II Trionfo della Santa Sede</eac-cpf:span>, which besides
											passing through several editions in Italy, has been translated into several European
											languages. In 1800, he became a member of the Academy of the Catholic Religion, founded
											by Pope Pius VII (1800-1823), to which he contributed a number of memoirs on theological
											and philosophical questions, and in 1805 was made abbot of San Gregorio on the Caelian
											Hill.</eac-cpf:p>

										Edwards (1759-1838). He married in 1780 Diana Middleton (1762-1823 suo jure Baroness
