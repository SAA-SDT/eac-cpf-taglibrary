               <p>The Encoded Archival Context Working dedicates the 2010 EAC-CPF Schema and Tag Library to the memory of Per-Gunnar Ottosson. P-G, as he was known to his many friends around the world, played a key role in the development
                  of many international archival standards. He played a critical role in the early development of EAC, but illness and his death in 2008 prevented him from seeing the EAC-CPF work completed. He will be remembered for his
                  keen intelligence, collaborative skills, and wonderful wit. Above all, he will be fondly remembered as a friend. </p>

               <p>The EAC-CPF Tag Library should be considered a living document. As such, it will continue to to be developed as users suggest areas in need of clarification or expansion. The EAC Working Group encourages implementers to
                  provide any queries, comments, and suggestions regarding the tag library and its content. In addition, the contribution of examples is highly encouraged. Questions, comments or examples may be directed to the Chair of the
                  EAC Working Group, Katherine M. Wisser (<ref target="mailto:wisser@simmons.edu">wisser [at] simmons.edu</ref>).</p>
               <p>The underlying encoding of the Tag Library is based on TEI P5 and is designed to facilitate incorporating documentation into the schema to provide guidance in XML editors. While the initial release of the Tag Library is in
                  English, the underlying encoding is designed to facilitate providing the Tag Library in additional languages at later dates.</p>
               <p>A PDF version of the Tag Library will also be released at a later date.</p>

               <head>Background</head>
               <p>EAC began with a 1998 effort by Richard Szary, Wendy Duff, and Daniel Pitti to envision a standard for encoding and exchanging authoritative information about the context of archival materials. This standard would provide
                  a communication standard for the exchange of authority records based on International Standard for Archival Authority Records—Corporate Bodies, Persons, Families (ISAAR(CPF)) and would parallel the standard for encoding
                  archival record finding aids that was found in Encoded Archival Description (EAD). As EAD enabled the practical expression of General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G)), the new standard would enable the
                  expression of ISAAR(CPF). A parallel standard would preserve and strengthen the essential duality that characterizes archival description when it is presented in archival finding aids.</p>
               <p>A separate standard would pave the way to eliminating some practical problems found in the use of EAD, which had been developed as a comprehensive solution for encoding standalone finding aids—the dominant presentation
                  model—which held all forms of descriptive data about archival records. Since materials by or about a single entity might be found in many fonds or many repositories, there is much redundant effort in recording information
                  about the same entity. In addition, these duplicative efforts can result in great inconsistency, which bedevils both users, in finding and interpreting materials, and archivists, in creating accurate and complete
                  references to such entities.</p>
               <p>Yale University hosted an international meeting in 1998. The meeting was organized by Richard Szary and funded by the Digital Library Federation. The goals of the meeting were to plan the funding and development of an
                  encoding standard based on ISAAR(CPF).</p>
               <p>In 2001, with financial assistance from the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, a second international working group met in Toronto. This meeting produced the Toronto Tenets, the principles that gave shape to the proposed
                  standard. The group also established goals for the standard, mapped out the broader parameters of the Document Type Definition (DTD), and established a working group to create a fully formed syntax. The DTD achieved its
                  Beta distribution in 2004, beginning a long testing phase as it was applied in several European and U.S. projects. Informed by the results that emerged from this testbed, the Society of American Archivists' Encoded
                  Archival Context Working Group was formed in 2007 to carry this work forward to the creation of a standard version, and expression in a schema and Tag Library. With the support of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, the
                  IBC (Instituto per I beni artistici culturali e naturali) of the Regione Emilia-Romagna, the Archivio di Stato di Bologna, OCLC Research, and the National Library of Australia, the EAC Working Group met for three days in
                  Bologna, Italy in May 2008 to lay the foundation of the existing EAC-CPF standard. On-going work via electronic mail and conference calls continued the work started in Bologna. A review period of the final draft was
                  offered in August to November 2009, and completed schema was released in February 2010. The Working Group is indebted to archivists throughout the international community for their input, review, and testing of the schema
                  during its development phase.</p>
               <p>Archival description includes information about the content, intellectual and physical attributes of the material, as well as information about the context of their creation and use. The context of the creation and use of
                  material is complex and multi-layered and may involve individuals, families, organizations, societies, functions, activities, business processes, geographic places, events, and other entities. Primary among these entities
                  are the agents responsible for the creation or use of material, usually organizations or persons. With information about these agents, users can understand and interpret the records more fully since they will know the
                  context within which the agents operated and created and/or used the material. Contextual information about these agents can be used either as a component within descriptive approaches that fully integrate contextual
                  information into descriptive products, as archives have traditionally done, or as an independent system that is linked to other descriptive systems and products that focus on content.</p>
               <p>Encoded Archival Context – Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF) primarily addresses the description of individuals, families and corporate bodies that create, preserve, use and are responsible for and/or
                  associated with records in a variety of ways. Over time, other types of contextual entities may evolve under the larger EAC umbrella, but currently its primary purpose is to standardize the encoding of descriptions about
                  agents to enable the sharing, discovery and display of this information in an electronic environment. It supports the linking of information about one agent to other agents to show/discover the relationships amongst
                  record-creating entities, and the linking to descriptions of records and other contextual entities.</p>
               <p>EAC-CPF is a communication structure for archival contextual information for individuals, corporate bodies and families. It supports the exchange of ISAAR (CPF) compliant authority records. ISAAR (CPF) "determines the
                  types of information that could be included in an archival authority record and provides guidance on how such records may be deployed in an archival descriptive system." ISAAR (CPF) also notes that "[s]uccessful automated
                  exchange of archival authority information over computer networks is dependent upon the adoption of a suitable communication format by the repositories involved in the exchange. Encoded Archival Context (EAC) is one such
                  communication format which supports the exchange of ISAAR(CPF) compliant archival authority data over the World Wide Web" (ISAAR (CPF), 2003, 15). EAC-CPF provides a mechanism for enabling the full expression of ISAAR
                  (CPF), however it may also contain some additional elements or technical content not contained within ISAAR (CPF).</p>
               <p>Based upon the Toronto Tenets, established in 2001, the following have informed the development of the schema: <list type="ordered">
                     <head>Definitions and Uses</head>
                     <item n="1">Archival context information consists of information describing the circumstances under which archival materials have been created, maintained and used. This context includes, but is not limited to, the
                        identification and characteristics of the persons, organizations, and families (agents) who have been the creators, users, or subjects of records, as well as the relationships amongst them.</item>
                     <item n="2">Context information about agents is not data that describes other information resources, but rather data that describes entities that are part of the environment in which those information resources (e.g.,
                        records) have existed.</item>
                     <item n="3">The recording of context information about agents in archival information systems directly supports a more complete description and understanding of records, as well as the provenance approach to retrieval
                        of these records across time and domains.</item>
                     <item n="4">Context information about agents can also have value as an independent information resource, separate from its use in supporting the description, retrieval, and interpretation of records.</item>
                     <item n="5">This model is also intended to support the exchange and sharing of context information about agents, especially in those instances where repositories have holdings or interests that have context information
                        in common.</item>

                     <item n="6">Each instance of context information about agents describes a single entity.</item>
                     <item n="7">The model provides a framework within which the full range and depth of context information about agents can be recorded and suggests a minimum set of elements for describing an entity, but defers

                     <item n="8">The model defines a universe of elements used to describe agents and the structure of interrelationships amongst those elements. These elements and structure support the discovery, navigation and
                        presentation of context information about agents and the linking of that information to descriptions of archival material or to other contextual entities, especially those encoded according to EAD, MARC, and similar
                        standards.</item>
                     <item n="9">The model supports the linking of descriptions of contextual entities to digital or other surrogate representations of those entities.</item>

               <head>EAC-CPF Concepts</head>
               <p>Agents are complex. For example, one agent can consist of multiple identities, or a single identity can be associated with several different agents. This fact necessitates the structure of this standard to account for the
                  various ways in which agents can be expressed. In order to accommodate the variety of agents, several concepts are defined:</p>
               <list type="simple">
                  <item>SINGLE IDENTITY: one person (or corporate body or family) with a single identity represented in one EAC-CPF instance. (Most common)</item>
                  <item>MULTIPLE IDENTITY-MANY IN ONE: two or more identities (including official identities) with each represented by distinct descriptions within one EAC-CPF instance. Can be programmatically converted into Multiple
                     Identity-One in Many. (Less common though not rare).</item>
                  <item>MULTIPLE IDENTITY-ONE IN MANY: two or more identities (including official identities) each represented in two or more interrelated EAC-CPF instances. Can be programmatically converted into Multiple Identity-Many in
                     One. (Less common though not rare).</item>
                  <item>ALTERNATIVE SET: derived EAC-CPF instance that is based on and incorporates two or more alternative EAC-CPF instances for the same entity. To be used by a consortia or a utility providing union access to authority
                     records maintained in two or more systems by two or more agencies. Alternative EAC-CPF instances may be in different languages or in the same language.</item>
                  <item>COLLABORATIVE IDENTITY: a single identity shared by two or more persons (e.g. a shared pseudonym used in creation of a collaborative work). Use Multiple Identity-One in Many. (Rare).</item>
               </list>
               <p>EAC-CPF has been created to accommodate this variety of identities, and includes a number of ways to express complexities based on individual repository or aggregator preferences. These options reflect a design principle
                  that underscores increased opportunity for repositories or aggregators to customize the standard for specific needs while at the same time ensuring future aggregation. These flexibilities also reflect an acknowledgement
                  that some fundamental philosophical differences with regard to the description of identity exist in the international community. EAC-CPF maintains a neutral stance on those philosophical differences, and instead has
                  accommodated the various options without precluding aggregation in the future.</p>
               <p>For purposes of this tag library, agents refer to repositories or services creating or maintaining EAC-CPF records, while entities refer to those for which the records are about.</p>

                  <head>Introduction</head>
                  <p>Each EAC-CPF document contains two mandatory elements, the <gi>control</gi> element and either the element <gi>cpfDescription</gi> or <gi>multipleIdentities</gi>. The <gi>control</gi> element contains data used in the
                     control of the entity description, and to provide context for that description. <gi>cpfDescription</gi> contains information on the name structures, descriptive elements, and relationships. <gi>multipleIdentities</gi>
                     is used when there is more than one <gi>cpfDescription</gi>. These two wrapper elements contain specific elements to support the functional intentions of the parent or containing element.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>The <gi>cpfDescription</gi>-Corporate body, person or family description, comprises the description of the entity. Similar to the <gi>control</gi> element, <gi>cpfDescription</gi> has several complex subelements used to
                     describe different features of the entity:</p>
                  <list type="simple">

                  <p>The most complex element in the EAC-CPF schema is the <gi>identity</gi> element. In addition to needing to accommodate one or more names used for or by the entity, <gi>identity</gi> must accommodate two or more parallel
                     names in different languages or scripts. In countries where there is more than one official language, such as Canada, names of corporate bodies have more than one language. The <gi>identity</gi> contains a required
                        <gi>entityType</gi> and one or more <gi>nameEntry</gi> and/or <gi>nameEntryParallel</gi> elements. It also includes an optional <gi>entityId</gi> and <gi>descriptiveNote</gi>. The <gi>nameEntry</gi> element is
                     constructed of one or more <gi>part</gi> elements and contains the attributes <att>scriptCode</att>, <att>xml:lang</att>, <att>transliteration</att>, and <att>localType</att> to provide precision about the language and
                     script of the names if desired. It includes an optional <gi>useDates</gi> element to identify dates of use of a name. <gi>nameEntryParallel</gi>, which is intended for use when the same name is expressed in different
                     languages, contains one or more <gi>nameEntry</gi> elements and an optional <gi>useDates</gi> element. For example, within the context of the Archive of Ontario, parallel French and English headings can be designated by
                     placing the repository code of the Archive in two parallel <gi>nameEntry</gi> elements, with the two different headings being distinguished by the values in the <att>xml:lang</att>.</p>
                  <p>Within <gi>identity</gi>, names represented through <gi>nameEntry</gi> or <gi>nameEntryParallel</gi> may be selected as authorized or variant names. The <gi>authorizedForm</gi> and <gi>alternativeForm</gi> elements are
                     available within <gi>nameEntry</gi> and <gi>nameEntryParallel</gi> elements to identify the status of the name according to a particular set of rules. The content of the element is the identification of those rules.
                     Additionally, within <gi>nameEntryParallel</gi>, a single <gi>nameEntry</gi> may be preferred over others. A <gi>preferredForm</gi> element is available in that instance to identify the preferred form of the name
                     according to a particular set of rules. The content of the element identifies those rules.</p>

                  <p>The <gi>description</gi> accommodates a variety of both controlled and prose descriptions of entities. The contained elements closely reflect the descriptive categories outlined in ISAAR (CPF). Descriptive elements
                     generally have a singular and plural form, the latter being used for those cases of multiple instances of a descriptive category or less formal prose description. For example, <gi>function</gi> would be used for a
                     single function term, <gi>functions</gi> will bundle more than one function descriptor or alternatively, it will allow a discursive description. Most elements within <gi>description</gi> include an optional
                        <gi>descriptiveNote</gi> element to provide explanatory text. Elements for description include:</p>

                  <head>
                     <gi>relations</gi>
                  </head>
                  <p>As a component of archival description, entity description must be brought into relation with the other descriptive components. Entity descriptions must be dynamically related to the record descriptions for which they
                     provide context, and the functions and activities in which the entities engage and that the records document. With the exception of unique relations, it is the nature of relations that they take place among entities and
                     not within them. Entities are related to other entities, to activities and functions, and to records. Similarly, activities and functions are related to other functions and activities, to creators, and to records; and
                     records are related to other records, to entities, and to functions and activities. Each entity, record, or function/activity description can thus function as a node in a set of relations.</p>
                  <p>Because relations occur between the descriptive nodes, they are most efficiently created and maintained outside of each node. A person, for example, can be related to one or more persons, organizations or families; to
                     one or more archival records, books, journals, and museum objects; and to various occupations and activities. Each of the related entities can be related to one or more other entities. To record all of these relations
                     in the description of each node is inefficient, as correction of an error would require updating two or more descriptions.</p>
                  <p>While maintaining relations independent of descriptions is efficient, when communicating descriptions between systems or to users it will be necessary to assemble or gather and represent the related descriptions using
                     descriptive surrogates. Each surrogate for a related description will optimally include both human- and machine-readable information. The human-readable information provides succinct descriptions of the related entity,
                     entity records, or function/activity sufficient to enable identification and a relevancy judgment. The machine-readable information supports a traversable link to the related description.</p>
                  <p>There are three elements for describing relations with other descriptive entities that are included in the <gi>relations</gi> element: <gi>cpfRelation</gi>, <gi>functionRelation</gi>, <gi>resourceRelation</gi>. Within
                     each of these relations elements, there are: <gi>relationEntry</gi>, <gi>objectXMLWrap</gi>, <gi>objectBinWrap</gi>, <gi>date</gi>, <gi>dateRange</gi>, <gi>dateSet</gi>, <gi>placeEntry</gi> and <gi>descriptiveNote</gi>
                     elements. Individual relations include optional attributes related to the type of relation that is being described. These include:</p>
                  <list type="simple">
                     <item>
                        <gi>cpfRelation</gi> — includes an attribute <att>cpfRelationType</att>; values are identity, hierarchical, hierarchical-parent, hierarchical-child, temporal, temporal-earlier, temporal-later, family,
                        associative.</item>
                     <item>
                        <gi>functionRelation</gi> — includes an attribute <att>functionRelationType</att>; values include controls, owns, performs.</item>
                     <item>
                        <gi>resourceRelation</gi> — includes an attribute <att>resourceRelationType</att>; values include creatorOf, subjectOf, other.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Other attributes available for the relation elements include <att>lastDateTimeVerified</att>, and the suite of simple Xlink attributes.</p>
                  <p>There are two principal rationales behind the primitive or basic typing of relations. First, there is general interest in enabling coherent expression and navigation of relations as well as creation of graphic displays
                     of organizational charts, family trees, and time lines. The primitives are an experimental attempt to provide the data necessary to construct such displays. At this point, there has been no attempt to test the utility
                     of the structures with graphic displays. Second, basic information about the nature of relations is necessary in order to make the relationship intelligible to users. Given cultural and institutional differences, the
                     number of possible relation types is, in principle, unlimited. EAC-CPF designers decided, though, that to achieve a minimum level of functionality there needed to be consensus on a set of basic or primitive relation
                     types.</p>

               <div>
                  <head>xlink</head>
                  <p>The EAC-CPF schema includes support for linking to external resources using a limited subset of the xlink standard, which is defined at <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/</ref>. The
                     xlink attributes can be used to create and describe links between resources. In particular they can be used to reference a richer set of relationships than those which are supported by @cpfRelationType,
                     @functionRelationType, and @resourceRelationtype. The xlink attributes are available on the following elements: <gi>citation</gi>, <gi>cpfRelation</gi>, <gi>functionRelation</gi>, <gi>resourceRelation</gi>,
                        <gi>setComponent</gi>, and <gi>source</gi>.</p>
                  <p>A more complete description of each these attributes is provided in the attributes section of the tag library, but the following information is intended to summarize how they might be used in conjunction with each
                     other.</p>

                     <item>
                        <att>xlink:type</att> — This attribute is required if any of the other xlink attributes are used on the parent element. It takes the fixed value of 'simple' since EAC-CPF's implementation of xlink only supports
                        outbound links to one resource. If multiple outbound links are required, each link should be represented in a new parent element.</item>
                  </list>

                        described in the EAC-CPF resource and the resource to which it is linked. When used on <gi>citation</gi>, <gi>setComponent</gi>, and<gi>source</gi>, it provides an explicit and perhaps more precise description of the
                        relationship that is implied by the context of use. The value must be a valid URI.</item>
                     <item>
                        <att>xlink:role</att> — This optional element is used to provide a reference to the nature of the linked remote resource. It specifically provides a means to specify the nature of a linked resource in
                           <gi>resourceRelation</gi>, as described in ISAAR (CPF) 6.2. The value provided must be a valid URI.</item>

                        example, an application can be instructed to load the resource when the parent xml document is loaded or only when the page is requested by a user or application.</item>

                        <att>xlink:show</att> — This optional attribute may be used in conjunction with xlink:actuate to instruct an external application as to the manner in which the linked resource should be shown to the user when it is
                        resolved. For example, the application can be instructed to replace the current xml document when loading the resource or to load it in a new window or tab.</item>
                     <item>
                        <att>xlink:title</att> — This optional element may be used to provide a caption or title that an external system or application may use when presenting a link to the user.</item>

                  <p>Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox are the only common client application which include native support for a limited range of xlink attributes. As a result, implementers of EAC-CPF will need to provide for the full
                     implementation of the xlink attributes using server-side instructions.
