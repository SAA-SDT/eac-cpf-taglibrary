							semantically weak. The value of the <att>localType</att> must conform to W3C Schema Part 2:
							Datatypes, anyURI. To facilitate exchange of EAC-CPF instances, it is highly recommend that
							the URI be absolute and resolvable to a local resource that describes the semantic scope and
							use of the value.</p>
